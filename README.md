**Portfolio Description**

This is the start of building my portfolio and it's currently in JS.

The design is CLI-like interface where one navigates with commands.

It has an option to render to a normal website.

It uses some APIs such as weather, location, device ID and network pinging.

Hopefully I will be able to generate what I have in mind.
